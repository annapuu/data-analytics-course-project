# Data Analytics Course Project

This project is the final project of the Data Analytics course, which was the last of five courses of my 4.5 months long Data Analyst retraining. It's purpose was to show what I had learned during the course, to show my thought process and structure, how I handle new data and how I explore it.

This project was initially documented in German and with the help of [deepl](https://www.deepl.com/translator) translated into English.

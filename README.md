# Data Analytics Course Project

This project is the final project of the Data Analytics course, which was the last of five courses of my 4.5 months long Data Analyst retraining. It's purpose was to show what I had learned during the course, to get to know the kiva-dataset we were provided with and to explore it.

This project was initially documented in German and with the help of [deepl](https://www.deepl.com/translator) translated into English.

## Files
- data_abschlussprojekt.csv: the initial dataset, which is too big to easily ulpoaded here on github (should be avaible on kaggle, by kiva)
- data_peparation.ipynb: the jupyter notebook which includes initial information about the platform kiva and the dataset by my course instructor and my whole data preparation process

## Libraries

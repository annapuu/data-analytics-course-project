# Data Analytics Course Project

This project is the final project of the Data Analytics course, which was the last of five courses of my 4.5 months long Data Analyst retraining. It's purpose was to show what I had learned during the course, to show my thought process and structure, how I handle new data and how I explore it.

This project was initially documented in German and with the help of [deepl](https://www.deepl.com/translator) translated into English.

## Files
- data_abschlussprojekt.csv: the initial dataset, which is too big to easily ulpoaded here on github (should be avaible on kaggle, by kiva)
- [abschlussprojekt_data_peparation.html](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://raw.githubusercontent.com/annapuu/data_analytics_course_project/main/abschlussprojekt_data_peparation.html): this jupyter notebook includes initial information about the platform kiva and the dataset, which were provided by my course instructor, and my whole data preparation process
- 01_data_preparation.pkl: dataset after the preparation and cleaning process (file too big)
- abschlussprojekt_EDA.ipynb: this notebook works with the prepared dataset and a first explorative approach of the data (will be provided soon)
